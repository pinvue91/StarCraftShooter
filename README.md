A verticle shooter console game I created when I first started learning how to code.
This project was mostly a coding challenge to myself. I wanted to see if I could turn a C# console project into a video game. 
This game is based off fimiliar characters from Blizzard's Star Craft.
I plan on refactoring many things and hopefully finishing it soon.
